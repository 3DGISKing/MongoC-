CompositeOperation = "destination-in" refers to a specific value of the globalCompositeOperation property in the HTML5 Canvas 2D API. This property dictates how new shapes or images (the "source") are drawn onto an existing canvas (the "destination").
When globalCompositeOperation is set to "destination-in", the following occurs:
Only the part of the existing content (destination) that overlaps with the new shape/image (source) remains visible.
The new shape/image itself is used as a mask.
Any part of the existing content that does not intersect with the new shape/image becomes transparent.
The new shape/image itself is not drawn, only its shape is used to define the visible area of the destination.
In essence, "destination-in" masks the existing canvas content using the shape of the new content being drawn, revealing only the overlapping areas of the destination.
