Vue 3 technical review
Vue 3, released in September 2020 and made the default in February 2022, represents a significant evolution of the Vue.js framework, bringing substantial improvements in performance, developer experience, and scalability. 
Here's a breakdown of the key technical aspects of Vue 3:
1. Performance enhancements
Faster Virtual DOM: Vue 3 features a redesigned Virtual DOM implementation with a new diffing algorithm, resulting in faster mounting, patching, and rendering, particularly noticeable in large-scale applications.
Smaller Bundle Size: Vue 3 is more tree-shaking friendly, allowing developers to include only the necessary parts of the library, leading to smaller bundle sizes and faster load times. The core runtime is now approximately 12kb (gzipped).
Optimized Reactivity: The reactivity system has been rewritten using JavaScript's Proxy API, offering more efficient and flexible change tracking compared to Vue 2's Object.defineProperty-based system. 
2. Composition API
Logic Reuse and Organization: The Composition API introduces a new way to structure and organize component logic, allowing developers to group related logic together in a more modular and reusable manner, often referred to as "composables". This is a shift from the Options API where logic is separated by options like data, methods, etc.
Improved Readability and Maintainability: By allowing for a more logical grouping of code and the extraction of reusable logic into composables, the Composition API can significantly improve code readability and make large codebases easier to maintain and scale.
Better TypeScript Integration: The Composition API was designed with TypeScript in mind, providing better type inference, cleaner typings, and a more seamless experience for developers using TypeScript. 
3. New features
Teleport: Enables rendering a component's content in a different part of the DOM tree, independent of its parent hierarchy, useful for modals, tooltips, and other overlay elements.
Fragments: Allows components to have multiple root nodes in their templates, eliminating the need for unnecessary wrapper div elements.
Suspense (Experimental): Provides a way to gracefully handle asynchronous components and display a fallback while they are loading. 
4. TypeScript support
Vue 3 was rewritten in TypeScript, offering first-class support for static typing, leading to better code quality, improved IDE support, and easier debugging, according to Monterail. 
5. Reactivity system
Vue 3 utilizes JavaScript Proxies to implement reactivity, allowing for more efficient tracking of changes in data, including nested properties and dynamically added properties, addressing limitations found in Vue 2.
The ref function is primarily used for primitive values, while reactive is ideal for objects and arrays. 
6. Migration considerations
Breaking Changes: While Vue 3 maintains a high level of compatibility with Vue 2, there are some breaking changes that require careful review and testing during migration.
Library and Plugin Compatibility: Some third-party libraries and plugins may not yet be fully compatible with Vue 3, requiring developers to check their dependencies and potentially find alternatives or wait for updates.
Shift in Thinking (Composition API): Adopting the Composition API requires a shift in how developers structure their components, which can be a learning curve for those accustomed to the Options API. 
In conclusion, Vue 3 offers significant improvements over its predecessor, making it a powerful and versatile framework for building modern web applications. Its enhanced performance, improved developer experience, and better scalability, thanks to features like the Composition API and first-class TypeScript support, position it as a strong choice for both small and large-scale projects. While the migration process might involve some challenges, the long-term benefits of adopting Vue 3 outweigh the initial effort.
